               <p>Volney Creek Arabians started as a dream of a young boy, Byron, a military son whose family was stationed in the North African deserts of Libya.  There he trained to ride the beautiful and athletic 'Barb' Arabians of Libya.  Byron competed in equitation, jumping and eventually racing his favorite Arabians.  His biggest dream was someday to have his own farm or 'fellah' where he could ride, breed and enjoy his Arabian horses or 'hisani' as the Arabs called them.  That dream has now come true at Volney Creek Arabians located in Red Lodge, Montana, a breath-taking 1300 acre ranch in the pure "Big Sky" Country.</p>
   <p>Our goal at Volney Creek Arabians is to produce a stunning, yet highly versatile Arabian. It is our belief that with the proper breeding program, we can produce the classic Arabian "type" combined with remarkable athleticism.</p>
   <p>At Volney Creek Arabians we also stress the importance of one-on-one contact through every stage of a foal's development, and in believing so have elected to produce only a few foals per year. The quality of our foals is our top priority so that we may be able to provide you with an animal that will be successful at every level of competition, be it at the National, International or Regional level of halter or performance.</p>
   <p>Our foundation mare is the award-winning Khadraj NA daughter Broken Promises PGA (Khadraj NA x Promises V). "Promises" was named U.S. Reserve Champion Junior Mare in 2008 as well as 2007 Canadian Reserve National Champion Futurity Filly Breeding.   She also has numerous Regional Championships in her long list of winnings. Led by Keith Kritchke in both successful National Championships, Keith states "Promises epitomizes the "Khadraj look" with an amazing neck and throat and she is a great show horse, great to work with and has made my job look easy."</p>
   <p>Broken Promises PGA has recently produced two incredible and beautifully conformed foals from US and International Champions that are just now entering the show ring:  our beautiful and very 'typey' 2 year old filly Edenz Promise VCR (Eden C x Broken Promises PGA) and our stunning yearling colt Promised Victory VCR (Vitorio TO x Broken Promises PGA).   Affectionately known as "Penelope" in the barn, Edenz Promise VCR took 5th place in the 2014 Scottsdale International 2-YO Fillies Class and went Top 10 (5th Place) in the super competitive SSS Class for 2 YO Fillies.  We are also very excited about "Promises" latest foal due on 3/10/14 which is by the incredible Champion Jullyen El Jamaal.  </p>
   <p>We are also very pleased to see our stunning young 2 year old Egyptian-related colt Antar Al Mishaal (Mishaal HP x Anjali IA) develop into a tall and athletic stallion.  "Arthur", as we call him, is a gentle colt and one of the last sons of the incredible Mishaal HP before his untimely passing.  On his mother's side he brings the great bloodlines of Sanadik El Shaklan and Shaklan to life.  Look for him in the halter ring in 2014.</p>
   <p>In addition to breeding world-class foals, Volney Creek Arabians also train and manage a select number of top class performance horses.  Our young mare Noble Ballet (IXL Noble Express+ x Bonita Afire) under the watchful training eye of Chris Culbreth has already won several Regional Championships and went Top 10 at the 2013 Canadian National Championship in Country English Pleasure Junior Horse. At the recent 2014 Scottsdale Arabian Horse Show, "Ballet" went 2nd in Country English Pleasure JTR 14 and Under and Top 10 in the Country English Pleasure Championship with Chris Culbreth in the saddle.  Noble Ballet is available for purchase.</p>
   <p>Debi's 6 year-old gelding AV Major Madre (Pysmadre x SJ Millissa) has already gone Top 10 at the US Nationals in 2012 and recently was Hunter/Pleasure Champion at Scottsdale in 2013.  Known affectionately as "Buddy" in the barn, Debi won several Regional Hunter/Pleasure Championships since acquiring him in mid-2013.  "Buddy" and Debi just had a very successful showing at Scottsdale 2014 with them going Reserve Champion in the AAOTR 55 and Over and Top 10 in the Select AATR Championship.</p>
   <p>The spirit of Volney Creek Arabians is that of partnership and an everlasting dedication to excellence.  We cannot accomplish our goals of excellence without the help of sincere and capable friends.  Thus, we want to extend a special thanks to Keith and Maureen Krichke of Krichke Training Center, Chris and Michele Culbreth of Culbreth Equine Training & Mgmt, LLC and Athala King and Maureen McCormack of Athala Arabians for their patient guidance in helping us to realize our dream.  The best is yet to come!
